# Capstone-Project
This project is the Final Year BTech Project.

We are using svm_dataset_2 (1).ipynb as final model as it has better accuracy.

Key highlights of this project:
- We compared the performance of three machine learning classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes on a dataset. The model with the best accuracy was chosen to predict if a news was fake or real.
- The dataset was created by web scraping news articles from news website. This dataset was updated with new data on daily basis.
- We retrained the model on weekly basis so it the remains aligned with current trends, improving predictive accuracy and robustness over time.
